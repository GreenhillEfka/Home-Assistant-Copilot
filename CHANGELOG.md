# CHANGELOG - AI Home CoPilot Core

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Dev Surface Module** — comprehensive observability and debugging system
  - **Structured logging service** with ring buffer (default: 500 entries), level filtering (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR)
  - **JSONL persistence** to `/data/dev_logs.jsonl` for audit trail and debugging
  - **Error tracking** with automatic counting by exception type, stack trace capture, most frequent error detection
  - **System health monitoring** including memory usage, Brain Graph metrics, 24h event counts, overall status
  - **REST API endpoints** at `/api/v1/dev/*`:
    - `/logs` — retrieve recent logs with optional level filtering and limits
    - `/errors` — error summary with counts and last error details
    - `/health` — current system health snapshot
    - `/diagnostics` — comprehensive system diagnostics export  
    - `/clear` — reset all logs and counters
  - **Event Processor integration** for automatic pipeline observability
  - **10 comprehensive unit tests** covering all logging levels, error handling, persistence, health monitoring
- **Dependencies**: Added `psutil==6.1.0` to Dockerfile for memory monitoring

### Technical Details
- Privacy-first: all logging is best-effort, failures never break main application flow
- Non-intrusive design: no performance impact on core operations
- Production-ready with proper error isolation and bounded memory usage
- Complete integration with existing Event Processor and Brain Graph modules

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Event Processing Pipeline** — completes the real-time data flow from HA → EventStore → BrainGraph
  - `EventProcessor` bridges event ingest with Brain Graph service for automatic knowledge graph updates
  - State changes create entity + zone nodes with `located_in` relationship edges
  - Service calls create service nodes with `targets` edges to affected entities (higher salience for intentional actions)
  - Post-ingest callback hook (non-blocking) enables pluggable downstream consumers
  - `EventStore.ingest_batch` now returns accepted events for immediate downstream processing
  - **11 new unit tests** (total: 76 across all Core modules)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Brain Graph Module** (`/api/v1/graph/*`): Complete knowledge representation system
  - **`/api/v1/graph/state`**: JSON API for bounded graph state with filtering (kind, domain, center/hops, limits)
  - **`/api/v1/graph/snapshot.svg`**: DOT/SVG visualization with themes (light/dark), layouts (dot/neato/fdp), hard render limits
  - **`/api/v1/graph/stats`**: Graph statistics + configuration (node/edge counts, limits, decay parameters)
  - **`/api/v1/graph/prune`**: Manual pruning trigger
  - **Privacy-first storage**: PII redaction, bounded metadata (2KB max), automatic salience management
  - **Exponential decay**: 24h half-life for nodes, 12h for edges with effective score calculation
  - **SQLite backend**: Bounded capacity (500 nodes, 1500 edges), automatic pruning, neighborhood queries
  - **HA event processing**: Hooks for state_changed and call_service events
  - **Complete test coverage**: 27 unit tests covering privacy, bounds, decay, pruning, neighborhood queries
- **Dependencies**: Added `graphviz` package to Dockerfile for SVG rendering

### Technical Details
- This establishes the central knowledge representation for entity/zone/device relationships
- Privacy-first design with automatic PII redaction and bounded storage
- No breaking changes, new endpoints accessible immediately
- All compile checks and unit tests passing ✓

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-10

### 🎉 Major Release: Tag System + Event Pipeline Foundation

This release introduces the foundational data architecture for the AI Home CoPilot system.

#### Added
- **Tag System Module** (`/api/v1/tag-system`): Complete privacy-first tag registry and assignment management
  - Canonical tag definitions with multi-language support
  - Persistent tag-assignment store with CRUD operations
  - Subject validation (entity/device/area/automation/scene/script)
  - Default tags: `aicp.kind.light`, `aicp.role.safety_critical`, `aicp.state.needs_repair`, `sys.debug.no_export`

- **Event Ingest Pipeline** (`/api/v1/events`): HA→Core data forwarding infrastructure
  - Bounded ring buffer with JSONL persistence
  - Thread-safe deduplication with TTL-based cleanup
  - Privacy-first validation and context ID truncation
  - Query endpoints with domain/entity/zone/temporal filters
  - Comprehensive statistics and diagnostics

- **API Security**: Shared authentication helper for token-based endpoint protection

#### Technical
- **Dependencies**: Added PyYAML 6.0.1 for tag registry YAML parsing
- **Storage**: Configurable paths via environment variables
- **Testing**: 19+ unit tests covering core functionality (tag registry, event store, API validation)

#### Developer Notes
- All tests passing ✓
- Code compiles cleanly with `python3 -m compileall`
- Ready for production deployment
- Privacy-first design with automatic redaction policies
