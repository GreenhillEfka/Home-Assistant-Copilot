# Start here — Home Assistant CoPilot (Core add-on)

This repository ships the **Copilot Core** Home Assistant add-on.

## Principles
- Local-first by default
- Privacy-first
- Governance-first (suggestions before actions)
- Safe defaults (bounded stores, optional persistence)

## Docs
- Ethics & Governance: `docs/ETHICS_GOVERNANCE.md`
- Changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`

If a guiding principle blocks a clearly better solution, we revisit it explicitly (issue + rationale + safeguards + doc update).
